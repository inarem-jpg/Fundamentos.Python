**Description:** just some python codes made for my first-year robotics engineering
  degree. The subject's name is fundamentals of python so don't expect anything
  super complex.

**Files:**
  --Random gigglebot codes
  -- A gigglebot remote-controled via radio using a microbit
  [Program A on the gigglebot-radio needs some working on (adding the detection
  of the orientation of the bot to print correctly and stuff), but I dont have one
  anymore to try to complete the code; if anyone ever doe complete it, let me know!]

  -- random microbit codes
  --codes using the turtle module 
  -- and the some random python codes

Just uploaded this in case anyone finds it helpful and to save for later! :D
